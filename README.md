## Exploring-Premier-League-Data-in-PostgreSQL
![](images.png)


This is an exhibition of my skills in using PostgreSQL to interact with a relational database.

The data used in this project is provided by Kaggle.com. This dataset covers every match played in the English Premier League's history, from the start in 1992, to the final week of the 2021-2022 season.

The SQL queries were run in a Jupyter Notebook.
